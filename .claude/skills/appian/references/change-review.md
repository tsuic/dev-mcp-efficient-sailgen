## Post-Change Verification

After creating or modifying any Appian design object, re-read it to confirm the change applied correctly. Don't assume success from a non-error response — verify the actual state matches your intent.

### What to Verify by Object Type

**Record types:**
- After creating a record type, retrieve it and check that the name, plural name, and description match what you specified
- Get the source configuration to confirm all fields were created with the correct field types, primary key designation, and length constraints
- If you set `createTable: true`, confirm the source configuration reflects the database table name, data source UUID, and schema

**Record type relationships:**
- After adding a relationship, list the record type's relationships to confirm it appears
- Verify the relationship name, type (ONE_TO_MANY, MANY_TO_ONE, ONE_TO_ONE), and target record type UUID are correct
- Check the other side — retrieve the target record type's relationships to confirm the bidirectional relationship was added

**Interfaces:**
- After creating an interface, retrieve it to confirm the name and description
- After adding inputs, list the interface's inputs to confirm each one has the correct name, type QName, and multiplicity
- After setting or updating the SAIL expression, get the expression back and verify it matches what you sent

**Expression rules:**
- After creating an expression rule, retrieve it to confirm the name, description, inputs, and expression body
- Verify that input names and type QNames match your intent
- Confirm the expression body starts with `=` and references the correct `ri!` input names

**Process models:**
- After creating a process model, retrieve it to confirm nodes, variables, and connections
- Verify the start form configuration — check that `interfaceInformation` references the correct interface UUID and that `ruleInputs` map correctly
- Confirm the security group name matches an existing group

**Sites:**
- After creating or updating a site, retrieve it to confirm all pages are present in the correct order
- Verify each page's `targetUuid` points to the correct interface
- Check that visibility expressions are set on the pages that need them

**Web APIs:**
- After creating a Web API, retrieve it to confirm the name, URL alias, HTTP method, and request body type
- If you set an expression body, retrieve it and verify it matches

**Constants, groups, folders, documents:**
- After creating any supporting object, retrieve it to confirm the name, type, and value (for constants) or parent relationship (for folders and groups)

### When to Skip Verification

- Deleting an object — if the delete call succeeds, the object is gone; no need to re-read
- Listing objects — read-only operations don't change state; nothing to verify
- Simple metadata updates (renaming an object) — low risk; verify only if the rename is critical to downstream references

## Cross-Reference Verification

Many Appian objects reference each other. After establishing cross-references, verify both sides to catch partial or broken links.

### Record Type Relationships

Relationships must be declared on both sides for Appian record type traversal to work:

1. After adding a MANY_TO_ONE relationship on the FK side, list relationships on the target record type to confirm the corresponding ONE_TO_MANY exists
2. After adding a ONE_TO_MANY relationship, list relationships on the child record type to confirm the corresponding MANY_TO_ONE exists
3. For many-to-many via junction tables, verify all four relationship declarations: two on the junction table (MANY_TO_ONE to each entity) and one ONE_TO_MANY on each entity pointing to the junction table

### Interface Inputs and SAIL Expressions

The SAIL expression references inputs via `ri!` — a mismatch causes runtime errors:

1. After setting a SAIL expression, list the interface's inputs
2. For each `ri!` reference in the expression, confirm a matching input exists with the correct name and type
3. If the expression references an input that doesn't exist, add the missing input before the interface is used

### Process Model Start Forms

Start forms connect process models to interfaces with mapped inputs:

1. After creating a process model with `interfaceInformation`, verify the interface UUID exists by retrieving the interface
2. Check that each `ruleInput` name in the start form configuration matches an actual input on the interface
3. Verify that `value` references (e.g., `pv!record`) correspond to process variables that exist on the process model

### Process Model Node References

Nodes may reference interfaces, record types, or expression rules:

1. For User Input Task nodes, verify the `interfaceUuid` in the configuration points to an existing interface
2. For Write Records nodes, verify the `recordTypeUuid` points to an existing record type
3. For Script Task nodes that reference expression rules via `rule!`, confirm those expression rules exist

### Site Page References

Site pages point to interfaces:

1. After creating or updating a site, verify each page's `targetUuid` by retrieving the referenced interface
2. If a page has a `visibilityExpr` that references constants (e.g., `cons!PREFIX_ADMIN_GROUP`), verify those constants exist and have the correct type (GROUP)

### Application Inventory

After creating objects with `appUuid`, verify they appear in the application:

1. List objects of the relevant type scoped to the application's `appUuid`
2. Confirm the newly created object appears in the list
3. If it doesn't appear, add it to the application explicitly using the tool that associates objects with an application

## Discrepancy Handling

When verification reveals a mismatch between what you intended and what actually exists, diagnose the issue and attempt a corrective action.

### Common Discrepancies and Corrections

**Missing field on a record type:**
- Symptom: a field you specified in `sourceAndCustomFields` doesn't appear when you list the record type's fields
- Likely cause: the field definition had an invalid `fieldType` or was malformed
- Correction: get the current source configuration, add the missing field with a valid field type, and update the record type with the complete field list

**One-sided relationship:**
- Symptom: a relationship exists on one record type but the corresponding relationship is missing on the other side
- Likely cause: you added the relationship on one side but forgot the other, or the second add failed
- Correction: add the missing relationship on the other record type — MANY_TO_ONE on the FK side needs a corresponding ONE_TO_MANY on the target, and vice versa

**Interface input missing:**
- Symptom: the SAIL expression references `ri!inputName` but the input doesn't exist on the interface
- Likely cause: the input was not added before the expression was set, or the add-input call failed
- Correction: add the missing input with the correct name and type QName, then verify the expression still works

**SAIL expression not set:**
- Symptom: retrieving the interface expression returns empty or a default placeholder
- Likely cause: the expression update call failed silently or the expression had a syntax error
- Correction: re-send the expression, ensuring it starts with `=` and all `ri!` references match existing inputs

**Process model start form mismatch:**
- Symptom: the process model's `interfaceInformation` references an interface input name that doesn't exist on the interface
- Likely cause: the interface input was renamed or the mapping used the wrong name
- Correction: either update the process model's `ruleInputs` to use the correct input name, or add the missing input to the interface

**Object not in application inventory:**
- Symptom: listing objects scoped to the application doesn't include a recently created object
- Likely cause: the `appUuid` was not passed during creation, or the association failed
- Correction: use the tool that adds objects to an application, providing the object's UUID and type identifier

**Site page pointing to non-existent interface:**
- Symptom: retrieving the interface UUID from a page's `targetUuid` returns a not-found error
- Likely cause: the interface was deleted, or the wrong UUID was used
- Correction: create the missing interface or update the site page with the correct interface UUID

### Discrepancy Reporting

When you detect a discrepancy:

1. State what you expected vs. what you found
2. Explain the likely cause
3. Describe the corrective action you're taking
4. After applying the correction, re-verify to confirm the fix worked
5. If the correction fails, report the issue to the developer with enough detail for them to investigate

## Error Interpretation

Errors from the Appian platform fall into categories that determine whether to retry, adapt your approach, or escalate to the developer.

### Retry (Transient Errors)

These errors are temporary and may succeed on a second attempt:

- **Timeout or connection errors** — the platform was temporarily unavailable; wait briefly and retry once
- **500 Internal Server Error with no specific message** — may be a transient platform issue; retry once
- **Rate limiting (429)** — you're making requests too quickly; wait and retry with a brief pause

Retry at most once. If the same error occurs on retry, treat it as a persistent error and adapt or escalate.

### Adapt (Wrong Parameters or Approach)

These errors mean your request was malformed or used incorrect values. Don't retry with the same parameters — fix the issue first:

- **400 Bad Request** — the request body is malformed or missing required fields. Check the error message for specifics. Common causes: missing required field, invalid field type name, wrong QName format, duplicate name.
- **404 Not Found** — the object UUID you referenced doesn't exist. The object may have been deleted, or you're using the wrong UUID. Re-discover the object by listing and searching.
- **409 Conflict** — a uniqueness constraint was violated. Common causes: duplicate record type name, duplicate Web API method + URL alias combination, duplicate constant name. Change the conflicting value and retry.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity** — the request is syntactically valid but semantically wrong. Common causes: invalid relationship configuration, circular dependency, field type mismatch.

When adapting:

1. Read the error message carefully — it usually identifies the specific problem
2. Fix the identified issue in your request
3. Re-send the corrected request
4. Verify the result after the corrected request succeeds

### Escalate (Permissions or Missing Prerequisites)

These errors require developer intervention — the agent cannot resolve them:

- **401 Unauthorized** — authentication failed. The agent's credentials are invalid or expired. Report to the developer.
- **403 Forbidden** — the agent doesn't have permission to perform this action. The object or operation requires higher privileges. Report to the developer with the specific action that was denied.
- **Missing data source** — if creating a database-backed record type fails because no data source is available, the developer needs to configure a data source in the Appian environment.
- **Missing connected system** — if a process model node references an integration or connected system that doesn't exist, the developer needs to create it manually (this is an untooled capability).
- **Platform configuration issues** — errors related to environment configuration (database connectivity, external system availability, license limits) require developer or admin intervention.

### Error Response Patterns

When an error occurs:

1. **Read the full error message** — don't just check the status code; the message body often contains the specific field or value that caused the problem
2. **Check your inputs against the error** — compare what you sent with what the error says is wrong
3. **Don't retry blindly** — if the error is a 400 or 422, retrying with the same parameters will produce the same error
4. **Log what happened** — when reporting to the developer, include: what you were trying to do, the error status code and message, and what you've already tried

### Recovery After Errors

If an error occurs partway through a multi-step operation (e.g., creating a record type succeeded but adding relationships failed):

1. **Assess what completed** — re-read the objects that were part of the operation to determine current state
2. **Don't start over** — if the record type was created successfully, don't delete it and recreate; continue from where the error occurred
3. **Fix forward** — address the specific failure and continue with the remaining steps
4. **Re-verify the full result** — after recovering, verify the entire set of changes, not just the step that failed

## Runtime Verification

After creating or updating any interface, test-render it to catch runtime errors that syntax validation misses.

### Interface Checks

After every interface create or update, test the interface and verify:

1. `diagnostics.error` must be null — any value means a runtime rendering failure
2. No `"-1"` values in rendered text — indicates a failed `.totalCount` or broken query
3. Grid column data must contain strings or proper component objects — NOT serialized `"[@attributes=..."` text (indicates a link/complex object placed directly in a value slot)
4. Filtered grids must return fewer rows than total record count — proves the filter parameter is working
5. Alert/count cards must show non-negative integers

If any check fails: identify the root cause from the rendered component tree, fix the expression, re-test until all checks pass, then proceed.

### Site Checks

After creating a site, GET it back and verify:
- Each page has a valid `targetUuid` (retrieve the interface to confirm it exists)
- Each `visibilityExpr` is a valid expression (e.g., `"true"`, `"=true"`, or a group membership check)

### Process Model Checks

After creating nodes, list all nodes and verify:
- The connection graph forms a valid path from Start (node 1) to End (node 2) — every node must be reachable
- XOR gateways have `decision.conditions` with valid `targetNodeId` values that reference existing nodes
- No orphan nodes (nodes with no incoming or outgoing connections, except Start and End)

### Cross-Object Wiring

After building multiple objects that reference each other (e.g., process model + interface + record action), explicitly verify the connections:

1. Record actions: retrieve the record type's actions and confirm `processModelUuid` points to an existing process model
2. Start forms: retrieve the process model and confirm `startForm.interfaceUuid` points to an existing interface
3. Summary views: retrieve the record type's views and confirm `interfaceExpression` references an existing interface via `rule!`
4. Site pages: retrieve the site and confirm each page's `targetUuid` points to an existing interface

Do not assume cross-references are correct because individual object creation succeeded — verify the wiring explicitly.
